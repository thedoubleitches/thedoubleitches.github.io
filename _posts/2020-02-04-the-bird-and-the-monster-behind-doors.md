New days ought to mean good things, if a good day doesn't bring good things, it isn't new at all. A smell of newly baked bread and hearty dishes hangs about the air, but the bird is outside and it wants to spread its wings and take me over a child's memories.

I see her in her four-year-old body, huddled against her mother and siblings in one small room, it's cold and they're all used to sleep together because all they got is each other. He calls, and a lump rises to her throat when he asks to talk to her, she realizes then that she would always have a problem talking on the phone. He asks about her, and she asks what matters the most to her: when are you coming back? On the weekend, he says. Comes the weekend and he doesn't show up, two men come to their door instead and her too big a brain worries that they're bringing bad news about him. They don't, they're here to take some of his things to him because they're going some nice place, they're his friends.

Anger is a dark red substance, it's a wave that engulfs you and darkens your eyes, and this is the first time she would feel it, without recognizing what it is, I see her itching to say all the bad things about him, curse him, hate him because he said he was working, but he lied; she swallows her rage like a blue bitter pill that was forced down her throat.

This would be the first time she witnesses a lie of his, there will be more to come, and the rage would never subside, but the lies would lose the element of surprise, and she would lose some of the feelings.

The bird soars a little higher, taking me away and the air freezes on my wet face. My wet face, I've been crying. The little girl needs someone to talk her through this and tend to her bruises, I want the bird to take me back but it perches its head in defiance. I can't go back. I can't tell the kid to preserve her heart because it's too late, she offered him the small reddish muscle and allowed him to gnaw on it, happy she could offer him something.

I am now looking on her at the age of eight, her mom asks what went wrong and she bursts into tears, hiding her little face under her mom's chin, hiding from the world. She hiccups a few unintelligible words about wanting a different life, a different father, caring, loving. She blurts out how jealous she is of her friends and how sad she feels when they're fighting and how she wishes they didn't live here, with him. Moms are very smart, hers tells her that all of this was absolutely normal and everyone lived, more or less, the same. The eight-year-old grows up and knows that none of her mom's reassuring words were true, that none of it was normal and only the less fortunate lived that way.

The child is no longer one, she's fifteen and frustrated when the realization hits that having a male figure in her life she could look up to is a lost cause. She cries red and black tears, filled with all the rage a drop of salty water could contain. She is still fifteen and all she wants is making him, the fanged man, proud; she studies hard and wishes he would look her way so he can see her clutching her top grades.

Seventeen and this is the first time she undergoes physical harassment, on the way to school. She is all rage and shame, first blaming herself for maybe wearing something a few centimeters too tight, but then she blames him, the monster behind the door, he had never been there and if he was, none of this would have happened. The man would have felt waves of confidence coming off her, he wouldn't have dared touch her. But he did because she is weak and walks hunched under the weight of absence.

Eighteen, she almost begs him to show some pride in her, he doesn't, he's a stranger. Nineteen, twenty and she stops caring, he's no one to her, and she wants to take him and wrench him out of her life.

The bird is gone now, and I'm left lighter? Heavier? Did I have to see all of this? The bird likes showing me the most unusual things all the time, it likes taking me on trips like this one, where we go high up and look at things from above, they look clearer and sharper from there, and the air is different where we go, it smells of loneliness and oversleeping to stop time.

New days ought to mean good things, if a good day doesn't bring good things, it isn't new at all.
