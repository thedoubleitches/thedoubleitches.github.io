Some days are brighter than others, some days I wake up okay with who I am, not wishing I was dead. These are days I don't want to hurt myself nor do I want to experience the feeling of standing way above everything with one foot on solid ground and the other one hanging in the air. Today is not one of them.

This is a day I want to detach myself from the bed but my head is clouded, heavy streams of fog obscure it, and an enormous weight is tying me to my place, weighing me down, and I'm not sure if I want to fight, or if I can fight. It shifts a little allowing me to stand up, but it doesn't leave, it clings to my body like a shadow.

I think that maybe if I wash my face, my head would clear up and I will stop hallucinating. But I look in the mirror and see the traces of tears that have streamed down my face for years, salty stinging tears that have made my wounds sizzle and burn.

I look into my eyes and promise myself sanity and well-being I know I cannot provide for it.

I wipe away traces of my weaknesses and pick up my smile from where I left it lying the night before and walk out.

Like a carousel, thoughts and questions spin in my head and I carefully choose one to ponder upon for the day, and wonder: how can I hate myself more today? How can I look down at myself and bring it farther down than it already is?
