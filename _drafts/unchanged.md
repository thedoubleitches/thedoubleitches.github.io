I thought everything had changed, I thought that things were now different and I didn't have to worry anymore. I thought we were happy and could be normal at last.

Look at you, standing before me, bellowing your lungs out of air; your lips turning blue, turning purple and blanching into a sickening white shade. I have turned your voice down though because I know what you're going to say, I know what these fits entail, and I simply look into your eyes, trying to see the human behind them, I'm trying to see some part of you that would tell me you don't mean what you're saying, that these words are being wrenched out of you by some invisible force.

I don't let my eyes waver, and I feel tears prickling at their corners, threatening to break down my whole self-composure, and I remember all the times you ever caused me to hurt, and the times I didn't let you break into my fortress. 

You turn around, and the one single tear trickles down, but I swat it away, more roughly than I should before it reaches the depths of me and waters the overgrown moss and vines that have been growing there. Veins intertwined with hate and fear, feeding on the life of me.

The love that exists between us is a toxic one, yet everlasting, because I know what they made you go through, I have seen your wounds, I have touched your wounds and my fingers came away drenched in a bloody mess that I know would never dry out or heal. And I have forgiven you, though I don't know if I'm in any position to do so; I have forgiven everything you did/said and everything you'll ever do/say. 

I have tried time and again to get closer to you, but you get defensive and push away, you hurt because you were hurt. I also got to see some of your vulnerability, and I believe that those moments are the truth of you. 

Your smile when you were holding me, the honest joy that sparked out of your eyes, the tight hugs that only break free with teary eyes, the heartfelt prayers, and words. That is who you are, not the harshness, nor the snide remarks. 

I am you, I see you in my words, in my thinking, my appearance, and I am proud of that because I know your worth; I know your essence isn't what they made you believe. 

I love you.
