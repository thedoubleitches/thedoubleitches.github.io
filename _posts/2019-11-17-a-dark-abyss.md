It's dark today, the floor is cold and hard and my head is pounding from all the tears I shed these past fifteen years.

I was four and you used to hold my hand, it always enveloped mine tightly and kept the cold and harshness away. Mornings meant I got to ride in the car with you and we'd take a road with no activity -the only one we could take- and I'll get to hold the steering wheel. You used to laugh at my confused face when you told me letting go of the steering wheel doesn't mean the car will crash. And I would laugh anxiously in return.

The car never crashed but my life did when you decided you will never steer it or even get close to it.

That day started bad, a fight as always and a frightened me driving away with you with tears in my eyes and a million questions in my head. Silly, childish questions that I never got an answer to.

They told you you had a chance to move away and you agreed, I didn't understand, but I thought that it meant a new place for all of us and maybe a new beginning, something we all needed.

I don't know exactly when my life started going downhill, maybe it was that year, or maybe that's just how it was supposed to be.

I am five and you're fighting again, I go to the bathroom and cry, assuming it's because of me. She told me about times when I wasn't and it all seemed fine and you were all happy. So I assumed I was the beginning of your end, I still do.

I don't remember much but things I remember are organized according to how painful they are to remember.

There were times when you would fight and there's only me to break you apart, a frail five-year-old body that will be weighed down at later times with unshed tears and bottled yells and fits of anger.

I remember how I used to walk haughtily to the teachers' room so I can eat the "lunch" you bought me, being your privileged daughter.

I remember how I came to love words, how on nights the fights got bad my siblings secluded me in another room and how I'd pick up a picture book and read the words over and over while shoving my fingers into my ears until all I could hear is the silence and the sound reading in my head.

Do you know what else I remember? I remember roads I had to walk on my own and wars I had to go to all alone, bare-footed and unarmored.

You put me out there and forgot to check up on me again, making me feel time and again what a heavy burden I was to you. But all I ever wanted was making you proud; all I wanted was to make myself as small and as uncostly as possible, never to let you feel my weight and presence. None of it ever worked. You decided you weren't going to be part of this story and I had/have nothing in my power to do to change that.

I invented a million stories about you, ones I used to tell myself and ones I consecrated to my peers, I used to tell them about you and the beautiful things you got me whenever you came back home, I used to tell them about all the places you took us, the cuddles you used to comfort us with and the cushions of affection you placed us on. Of course, none of it was ever true, it was all I ever wanted and never got.

There were times that were harder than others, times I thought more about the unfairness of life, times I hated you and wished you were dead because then I would be able to tell people something and they all would assure me of how proud you would be of me wherever you were. Everything would have been a lot easier if I have never known you, I would have never had hopes nor expectations.

The times I needed you by my side felt like falling down a dark abyss, I never really reached the end but I never stopped falling. It was too heart-wrenching. I just needed a break, a wall to lean on, a shoulder to cry on, maybe a hand to hold and guide me through all of this complexity we call life.

I wish you were there because life has been ridiculously hard and tiring, I needed/need your guidance, your presence, your affection. I need you even now because it's never late for that.

What I fear is that it would come a day when it would be too late for us to talk, when it would be too late to tell you how much I needed you and how many times I cried and cursed my ill-fortune because I knew everything would have been different if you were there.

By now I know that life is not a wish-granting factory, but the hope of having you in my life never faltered, it was always there and it will continue to be even though I realize it changes nothing.
