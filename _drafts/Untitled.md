Some days are brighter than others, some days I wake up okay with who I am, not wishing I was dead. These are days I don't want to hurt myself nor do I want to experience the feeling of standing way above everything with one foot on solid ground and the other one hanging in the air. Today is not one of them.

This is a day I want to detach myself from the bed but my head is clouded, heavy streams of fog obscure it, and an enormous weight is tying me to my place, weighing me down, and I'm not sure if I want to fight, or if I can fight. It shifts a little allowing me to stand up, but it doesn't leave, it clings to my body like a shadow.

I think that maybe if I wash my face, my head would clear up and I will stop hallucinating. But I look in the mirror and see the traces of tears that have streamed down my face for years, salty stinging tears that have made my wounds sizzle and burn.

I look into my eyes and promise myself sanity and well-being I know I cannot provide for it.

I wipe away traces of my weaknesses and pick up my smile from where I left it lying the night before and walk out.

Like a carousel, thoughts and questions spin in my head and I carefully choose one to ponder upon for the day, and wonder: how can I hate myself more today? How can I look down at myself and bring it farther down than it already is?

Hanging with my garments is a thick coat of desperation and invisibility I drop on my shoulders and will it to help me preserve myself today as well.

I head out to face a world I didn't choose to come to but I chose to stay in, out of cowardice maybe, fear, hesitation. It only matters that I stayed. Everything goes by in a haze, as though these waves of feeling are carrying me, huddling me and rocking me into a fake sense of serenity.

The light is too strong, the voices too loud and the banging in my skull doesn't falter. If I could just make the light less bright so I can just let my eyelids droop and carry me away, and if I could just lower down the voices and plug earphones blasting with silence.

My patience is scarce and I purse my lips to keep my voice from booming in frustration, I go to the drawer of my useful junk and choose the loudest laugh I can produce, I put that out and leave it near me for potential usage. I no longer beg the voices in my head to quiet down, I let them take over and reign there and sometimes they even make it out and alert others of their existence.

Where do I go from here? My compass has broken and I find myself lost in time, lost in space and feelings. I find myself in a very tight place, and very dark. I like neither, but I stay and wonder how did I get here and no answer seems to be satisfying, no words tell me what I am doing here nor whether this is where I should be or not.

I suspect that I came here by mistake, my whole existence is a faux pas and I was thrown or I threw myself into tornadoes that wrecked my balance and my world.

I stand at the highest point I can find and look down at the floor below me, visualizing my body sprawled there on the ground, I scrunch my nose at the image and think of the seconds it takes to get to the ground, what will I be thinking while going down? Will I regret? Who and what will I see left behind? 

I remember that it once told me that it is everlasting and that even by jumping I wouldn't get rid of it, so I imagine myself going down, my back to the ground and I imagine the fear that would run through me like electric currents, or maybe the doubt or the regret. And so I just stay there, looking down and dare not take a step, neither back nor forward.

At the end of the day, I go back to where I started from, I slither into the crippling bed and the shadow positions itself over me as though it fears an attempt at running away. 

I can't run away, I am trapped here and my steps keep rewinding and bringing me back to the same places over and over.
