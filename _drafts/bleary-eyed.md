summary: Swallow the tears, drop by drop, the first is a bit bitter, airways constrict
  and threaten to cut the supply short, then you get used to the taste, welcome the
  feeling of release, any form of release of the tears bloating your body, painting
  it a sickly blue tint.

Swallow the tears, drop by drop, the first is a bit bitter, airways constrict and threaten to cut the supply short, then you get used to the taste, welcome the feeling of release, any form of release of the tears bloating your body, painting it a sickly blue tint.

To keep afloat the sea of thoughts is to breathe, small labored breaths, counting seconds as you inhale and exhale, slowly, you have all the time in the world. Time is not hard to find, thoughts to keep you busy throughout time are not hard to find either, they're abundant. You don't want them, you don't wish to dwell on them and they're angry, seething as they drag you from your sleep and force your head underwater, forcing you to look, to feel and to remember.

Memories are slippery creatures, thoughts too, you think you got them sorted out, you've done the right thing and cast them behind the bars of your self-control, but they slither like wraiths, nothing but shadows and hints of smoke vanishing and appearing everywhere, in the corners, in the mirror, in the irises of your eyes, under your lids as you shut them and will your mind to take you into oblivion.

What happens when you loosen the leash on yourself is that you lose control, waves of anger submerge you, flames licking at your insides, forcing you to act, pushing you to push away and retreat to your corner. You ride the wave and come out of it filthy with muck and debris, shoulders hunched, body heavied down, and aching limbs screaming in protest as you drag yourself through the shore, gasping for air but getting sand and cotton instead, filling your mouth, your lungs, suffocating you with their silkiness.

The tremors come last, they start at the tips of your fingers, sliding up your muscles, lifting your torso off first then the rest of your body, shaking you, freezing your limbs as you scramble for cover, and bury your face in a thorny pillow, screaming quietly, whimpering in a rasping voice as you gasp for air, flailing your arms around, trying to catch the molecules and stuff them into your body.

Pray for this to end, make a wish and cast it into the stale air around you, it gets stuck there and surges back at you, aiming for your throat, eyes glazed with a need to destroy. Bleary eyes, weary limbs, act now and regret later. Regret is not an option.
