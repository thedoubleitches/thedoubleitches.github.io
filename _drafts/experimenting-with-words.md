I sit in a corner of my heart and close my eyes, calling to me memories that I dropped on my way here, memories that litter my road; some are rose petals and sweet fragrances, and others glisten and draw a rainbow and blood from the soles of your feet.

'Please, let me remember something that would tell me who I am', I whisper to myself and whoever else might be able to help. I have always thought that something major has happened to me as a child and keeps me from ever remembering what my childhood was about, like trauma functions and blocks out all of your memories of something.

I never remember, and I keep losing who I am by not knowing and not remembering.

It's morning and I no longer need to pretend to be asleep but I keep my eyes closed and move around the deserted rooms of my heart, bumping now and then into my disappointments and slipping over my tears.

Something is off today, the house is incredibly quiet and the air is sweet with a fragrance that gets stuck in my throat and threatens to choke me.

I want to get out of my shell today and live someone else's life for once. Easy task, all I need is to stay out of sight today, and so I leave my heavy limbs behind and soar up into the sky. The air is clean and there's so much of it that it pierces my lungs. I lower down a bit and find my subject for the day.

His back is bent with burdens others put on it, he walks absent-mindedly, not seeing what's around him, as if there's a veil between his senses and the rest of the world, and just when I think of changing of subject, his head snaps into attention and he looks around him like a possessed, inhaling as if the air isn't enough, as if it doesn't go beyond his nostrils.

He keeps looking around and stops at an empty corner, closes his eyes for a little over a blink, clearing them up from whatever image has stuck to them, to no avail.

He can see her again, she hasn't made an appearance in so long that he thought she left never to return, so long that every night, he shuts his eyes tight and wills his mind to bring him back her image, and every night he fails, his eyes shedding unspent tears and broken promises. She is here again, and so is the feeling, and the pain.
