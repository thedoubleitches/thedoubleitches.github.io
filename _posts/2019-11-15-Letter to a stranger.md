I woke up this morning with your image stuck between my lashes and the taste of your name on my lips, this presence of yours that I generate never fails to brighten up my mood only for it to somber when the realization hits that you were never really there.

It all started with a random joke that wasn't meant for me; but after all, nothing was ever meant for me. Late-night talks and good mornings that should have never happened. Small things that I over felt and over lived, like a child trying but failing to keep grownup shoes on, shoes that looked very fancy but caused injuries.

You were a myth never meant to be brought into reality, and I was never meant to believe in it, not even for a fraction of a second. You were a coincidence that was never meant to occur, but it did and now I need to deal with the debris it left behind.

You told me you had a bad memory and I vowed to remember twice, once for you and once for my own sake. I took what I could of you and carefully wrapped the whole thing in the folds of my soul, so much it was all precious. I remember still the dark traits of your face, parts of it concealed by the shadow and the ones that shone brightly in contact with sunbeams. I remember how you smile, how your eyes crinkle and how my heart falters in response.

This is nothing like me, the blushing when you're in sight, the wobbly knees and short breath, the spinning head and en garde eyes looking for you everywhere, the all-nighters and carelessness. None of it is me, they're all you, or what you projected on me, it's the 'me' I wanted you to have, I needed to manufacture a quasi-brand new 'me' of fear of losing myself to you because I knew. I knew you weren't staying or even happening, and I had to make sure I wasn't going to forget myself amidst all of your details. You were too much, too loud that I had to recline into the corner and give you all the space you needed to bloom, but you were too busy elsewhere to notice what I was doing and feeling.

You are not to blame, neither am I. The fault is in our unfortunate roads that were only meant to cross once and never meet again.

You are to thank though for the happiness and the dreamlike state you let me experience, but you know the saying, it was too beautiful to be true. And it was all in my head, to begin with.

Will I want to relive all of your details again? Probably not. I wouldn't want to feel my whole being up in the air again nor feel my heart swell with things I don't know how to name. I want my feet to stay on the ground and my head to stay clear and sharp, the fuzziness and lightheadedness you left in your trail don't suit me.

I should have told you but now it's too late and I need to let go because the rope of your self is damaging my hands and I need to stop groping at it. It's no use and I know that when I let go I will fall back and down, deep down into places I don't want to be. Places I've escaped long ago, so dark and cold I still shiver at their memory.

Goodbye stranger, and thank you for stopping by.
