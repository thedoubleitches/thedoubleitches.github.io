I have always lived on borrowed identities, changing them as I see fit, moving from one to another swiftly as if walking into a perfectly fitting garment, having no trouble to alter and shift the pieces inside, moving them around like furniture, putting some in the attic, polishing the ones I need for the role, never discarding any piece. They all come handy at some time.

I don't particularly remember when the first time I borrowed an identity was, nor do I remember who it was I borrowed it from. I remember how easy it was, how I didn't think twice before slipping through the realms and choosing the one I deemed appropriate for the situation and the hearer. The first few times I did were for the fun of it, telling my peers who I wasn't, who I wished to be maybe, never who I am or how I live. Why? I could hear what any sensible person would ask. Was it shame? Self-loathing? An attempt to live the life I wished, maybe? It doesn't matter really, it never caused any harm. At least not to others. I grew up, the reasons changed probably. Did I always bother putting up a show because I had nothing in me worth seeing? Was I protecting some unseen part from unfathomable risks and dangers? 

Books offered more room for imagination and my growing self expanded, adapting to situations like a chameleon, never once finding it hard to blend in and give the people what they want. I would sit quietly at first, assessing those present around me, studying their looks, trying to scrounge what they saw in me, what they wanted to see in me, and I would give them just that. A quiet and polite girl once, a spirited and passionate youngling another, a cool person some other time. One look, one look is all it took for me to tell what the one across from me saw, and that was that. I would sift through my drawers and cupboards, selecting the materials I needed for a perfect performance. The right look, the right posture, the right words, tone, voice. Variants that made me the right fit for every situation.

Sometimes I failed spectacularly, I would misread a sign, a look and momentarily ruin the performance, but I always recovered, sometimes too slow to mend the damage. Sometimes I failed knowingly, putting on the wrong accessories just to see the other person gawk at me, maybe impressed, intimidated or offended. The satisfaction of failing because I chose to is always a pleasure. 

It haunts me though, who I am beneath all the lives I've lived. Actually, the lives I thought or had the illusion I lived. I have roamed worlds, real and fictional, seen people, fell in love, built friendships and unbreakable bonds, but all in my head. It was always up there and would always be.

Good thing is, there is no room for boredom, I shift and change, never hesitating to try on a new discovery, see how I can tailor it and pinch it in the right places to fit my own liking. The downside, however, is that I don't know where the basic form of me, the essence, the rawest shape, whatever it is, goes when I live what's not mine. Does it linger someplace deep, unreachable even by me? Or maybe it doesn't exist at all.
